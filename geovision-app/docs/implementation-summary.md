# Geological Upload Workflow - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new single-image upload workflow that replaces the previous three-image upload system. Users can now upload one geological image and interactively select different areas (map, legend, column) and cross-section points.

## Key Components Created/Modified

### 1. ImageAreaSelector (`components/image-area-selector.tsx`)
- Canvas-based area selection tool
- Allows drawing rectangles to select map, legend, and column areas
- Real-time preview of selected areas
- Validation of area completeness

### 2. MapPointSelector (`components/map-point-selector.tsx`)  
- Works with cropped map area only
- Displays start/end point selection for cross-section line
- Visual feedback with colored points and connecting line
- Coordinate mapping for accurate positioning

### 3. Image Cropping Utilities (`lib/image-cropping.ts`)
- Crops selected areas from source image
- Creates separate File objects for each area
- Validates area coordinates and dimensions
- Handles canvas-based image manipulation

### 4. Updated Upload Modal (`components/upload-modal.tsx`)
- Orchestrates the complete workflow
- Single file upload interface
- Sequential area selection → point selection → submission
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

## Workflow Steps

1. **Single Image Upload**: User selects one geological image file
2. **Area Selection**: User draws rectangles around map, legend, and column areas
3. **Point Selection**: User clicks two points on the map area for cross-section line  
4. **Processing**: System crops areas and prepares upload data
5. **Submission**: Cropped images and coordinates sent to backend API

## Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Simplified UX**: One file instead of three separate uploads
- ✅ **Visual Selection**: Interactive area selection vs. blind file selection
- ✅ **Better Validation**: Real-time feedback on selection completeness  
- ✅ **Accurate Coordinates**: Cross-section points selected on actual map area
- ✅ **Maintained Compatibility**: Backend API unchanged

## Technical Implementation Details

- Uses HTML5 Canvas API for image manipulation and area selection
- React hooks for state management across components
- File blob creation for cropped image upload
- Coordinate system mapping between full image and cropped areas
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

└── api.ts                   # Backend communication (existing)
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various image sizes and aspect ratios
2. Verify coordinate accuracy in cropped areas
3. Test error handling for incomplete selections
4. Validate backend integration with cropped images
5. Test on different screen sizes and devices

## Future Enhancements

- Add zoom/pan functionality for large images
- Implement drag-to-resize for selected areas  
- Add preview thumbnails of cropped areas
- Support for additional geological features
- Mobile touch interface optimization
